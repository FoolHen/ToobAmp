Use your Raspberry Pi as a guitar effects pedal. Configure and control PiPedal with your phone or tablet.

Use the pre-installed ToobAmp effects plugins, or use LV2 audio plugins.

PiPedal running on a Raspberry Pi 4 provides stable low-latency audio via external USB audio devices, 
or internal Raspberry Pi audio hats; and the Raspberry Pi 4â€™s processor provides enough power to run 
even the most demanding pedal plugins.
